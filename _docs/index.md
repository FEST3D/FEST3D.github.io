FEST3D (Finite-volume Explicit STructured 3-Dimensional) is computational fluid dynamic code written in Fortran 90 and Python for solving Navier-Stokes equations on a structured grid using state of the art finite-volume numerical methods.  It is a modular, multiblock finite-volume code developed to solve compressible flow problems encountered in the field of aerodynamics. It is still in development stage and is being verified against well-known test cases.
